## Phase 1: Project Setup
    Basic Project Initialization

Ensure your Next.js project is working by running npm run dev and verifying the starter page loads.
Set up a global layout and routing for the "Simple Games" app.
Directory Structure

Create a folder for the Hangman game: pages/hangman.
Add a new route for Hangman in your navigation if you have a menu or home page.
Storybook Setup

Confirm Storybook is correctly installed by running npm run storybook.
Create a folder like components/Hangman for reusable components and add a stories subfolder for Storybook files.

## Phase 2: Build the Hangman UI
    Design the Game Layout

    The layout could include:
        Word display with underscores (_) for hidden letters.
        Letter input or clickable alphabet buttons.
        Display for guessed letters and the remaining number of guesses.
        Hangman graphic or placeholder for visual progress.
        Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
        Create Components

    WordDisplay: Displays the word with underscores and guessed letters.
        AlphabetButtons: Renders the alphabet buttons for guesses.
        HangmanGraphic: Displays the visual progress of the hangman.
        GameStatus: Shows game information (e.g., "You win!", "Game Over").
        Add these to Storybook for isolated testing and previewing.

## Phase 3: Implement Game Logic
    Game State Management

        Use useState or a context for state management:
        Word to guess.
        Guessed letters.
        Remaining attempts.
        Game status (win/lose/in-progress).
        Game Logic

        Check if guessed letters are in the word.
        Update the display when correct letters are guessed.
        Track incorrect guesses and reduce remaining attempts.
        Detect when the player wins (all letters guessed) or loses (no attempts left).
        Keyboard Input

        Enable letter guessing via clicks or keyboard input events.

## Phase 4: Integrate Storybook and Test
    Storybook Stories

        Write stories for each component in different states:
        Example: WordDisplay with partial guesses, AlphabetButtons with some disabled letters.
        Integration Testing

            Play through the game in your browser and fix bugs.

## Phase 5: Add Enhancements
    Features

        Randomly select a word from a predefined list or fetch from an API.
        Track scores across sessions.
        Styling

        Add Tailwind animations for interactions (e.g., button presses, hangman graphic updates).
        Accessibility

        Make the game accessible by adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

## Phase 6: Deployment
    Deploy with Vercel

    Add the game to your app's navigation if not done earlier.
    Push changes to your GitHub repo, and Vercel will handle the deployment.
    Test

    Verify the deployed app works as expected.

## Phase 7: Feedback and Iteration
    Gather Feedback

    Share your app with friends or testers for feedback.
    Improve the user experience based on suggestions.
    Plan Next Games

    Start planning your next game while polishing Hangman.
